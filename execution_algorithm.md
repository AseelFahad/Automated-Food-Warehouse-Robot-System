# Execution Algorithm – Autonomous Food Warehouse

## Objective
To fully automate the operation of a food storage warehouse using robots, eliminating human intervention.

## Execution Algorithm

### 1. System Initialization
- Load a detailed warehouse map:
  - Define Working Area (robot-accessible space).
  - Define Working Envelope per robot (individual coverage zone).
  - Define Operations Envelope (where pick/place can be executed).
  - Mark Dead Zones (inaccessible or dangerous areas).
- Connect to inventory database.
- Define shelf positions, aisles, entry/exit points.

### 2. Coverage Validation
For each target location:
- Check if it lies within a robot’s Working Envelope.
- Ensure it's not within a Dead Zone.
- If in Dead Zone:
  - Mark as inaccessible.
  - Notify admin for remapping.

### 3. Task Reception
- Receive task (store/retrieve item).
- Identify or assign item location.
- Ensure the location is valid, accessible, and within a robot’s operational range.

### 4. Robot Assignment
- Evaluate available robots.
- For each robot:
  - Check coverage and route safety (avoid Dead Zones).
- Select optimal robot based on:
  - Distance, load capacity, battery, queue.

### 5. Task Execution
- Navigate robot to pick/drop point.
- Execute operation using gripper/arm.
- Confirm success via sensors.
- Navigate to destination and place item.

### 6. System Update
- Update product location and robot status.
- Log the completed task.

### 7. Continuous Monitoring
- Track robot status, layout changes.
- Update envelopes dynamically.
- Detect new Dead Zones through failed attempts.
