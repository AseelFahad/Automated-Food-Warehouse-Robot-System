# Automated Food Warehouse Robot System

This project presents the execution algorithm and operational envelope design for a fully autonomous food storage warehouse.

## ðŸ”§ Objective
To automate the operation of a food warehouse using mobile robots without any human intervention.

## ðŸ“Œ Included:
- âœ… Execution algorithm for the robot system
- âœ… Key elements of the working envelope:
  - Working Area
  - Working Envelope
  - Operations Envelope
  - Dead Zones

## ðŸ“‚ Files:
- `execution_algorithm.md`: Full detailed execution algorithm
- `working_envelope.md`: Description and structure of working envelope zones
- `diagram by AI`: Visual representations of robot movement envelopes
